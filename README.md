# REACT NATIVE Flex Week Project

My loose ideas going in were to work with things I hadn't worked with during our React section. I was thinking about a game of some type, graphics, animation, nueral networks, and data exchange via users.

Early on I found a chat tutorial that involved using react native and the giftedchat library utilizing the firebase real-time database system that Ray had mentioned.
I settled on an idea of some sort of texting game/analyzer combo app. 

I was able to set anonymous user login and texting with data storage and a 5x5 tic-tac-toe game that can be played via texted instructions.
The tic-tac-toe game is really just a placeholder for a better game but I wanted to get the basic implementation of multiple users interacting via text in an ongoing game that is updated and stored in local state.
