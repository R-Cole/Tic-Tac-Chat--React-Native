# Tic-Tac-Chat

My loose ideas going into this project were to work with things I hadn't worked with as much. The areas I was thinking about delving into were games, graphics, animation, sound manipulation, neural networks, and data exchange via anonymous users.

Early on I found a chat tutorial that involved using the react native gifted chat library utilizing the firebase real-time database system. 

I eventually settled on an idea of some sort of texting game/analyzer combo app. 

I was able to set anonymous user login and texting with data storage and a 5x5 tic-tac-toe game that can be played via texted instructions. The tic-tac-toe game is really just a placeholder for a better type game but I wanted to get the basic implementation of multiple users interacting via text in an on-going game that is updated and persisted in a data base. Very cool to see it on two devices with multiple anonymous users interacting!

My future vision for this app would be to have a few mini games and maybe some kind of text analyzers to choose from. The mini games would take simple commands as seen in the current tic-tac-toe game. Some games could involve drawing together or building something together. The text analyzer option would involve using the brain.JS neural network library to do comparisons of texts.
